To export functions from voter.go to python, my plan is to create a shared library that python can wrap with it's cffi package.

To create and shared library you would run 

go build -o voter.so -buildmode=c-shared voter.go

but voter.go uses go types. So we have to use the Cgo to rewrite stuff as exportable types
this is where I'm stuck. I should define a minimal interface, preferably from the voter_test.go file and try to adapt to that.
